        About Me ➡️
      </h2>
      <p className="text-xl font-extralight fontcormorand text-black">
        My name is Md. Iftekhar Hossain Shawon, and I am from Dhaka, the capital
        of Bangladesh — a South Asian country located in the Indian
        subcontinent. I am currently pursuing a BSc in Psychology at the
        National University of Bangladesh and am in the final year of my honors
        program. <br />
        <br /> I initially began programming as a hobby, but over time, it
        became a strong interest and a part of my skill development journey. I
        enjoy building web pages and experimenting with new styles and
        functionalities. <br />
        <br /> Beyond academics, I am passionate about traveling and have
        visited countries such as India and Bhutan. Reading is another favorite
        pastime, especially thrillers and historical books. <br /> I also have
        experience in extracurricular activities like scouting and debating. I
        was honored with the President’s Scout Award, the highest scouting
        recognition in Bangladesh, presented by the Honorable President.
        Additionally, I have received several awards for my achievements in
        various debate competitions.
